- [ ] capture fd into results via pipe
- [ ] capture to bytes (but encode how? base64?)
- spec validation
  - [ ] no fd is given more than once
- [ ] 'stdin', 'stdout', 'stderr' aliases to fds, consistently
- [ ] feed input into fd
- [ ] capture child proc setup errors and send back to parent
- [ ] fd to named temporary file, with path in result
- [ ] multiple procs in a single file, run in parallel
- [ ] results to file
- [ ] periodic update of results file while running
- [ ] rusage for self vs children
- [ ] input fd (stdin etc) from file
- [ ] cwd
- [ ] cwd before interpreting spec?
- [ ] umask
- [ ] pdeath_sig
- [ ] signal disposition
- [ ] transcript
- [ ] transcript client lib (Python?)
- [ ] handle signals and shut down cleanly
- [ ] don't wait; fire and forget (certain options only)
- [ ] daemonize
- [ ] report child pid to caller, somehow?
- [ ] poll for usage, other status, update intermediate file?
- [ ] state file
- [ ] state web service?
- [ ] shell command?
- [ ] YAML and other spec formats?
- [ ] process groups???
- [ ] build a spec from a running process
- [ ] compression support for output files
- [ ] accept {fd: spec,...} instead of [[fd, spec],...], if order is unimportant
- [ ] input/output fd from/to network (tcp, udp, websocket, REST API)
- file opening improvements
  - [ ] specify file mode as "0600"
  - [ ] specify file mode as "rw-r-----"
  - [ ] specify file mode as "u+rw g+r"
  - [ ] special file mode, that overrides umask
  - [ ] specify group for created file
  - [ ] create parent dirs for created file
